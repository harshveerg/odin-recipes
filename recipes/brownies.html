    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These brownies are super fun and easy to make! They can be made in about <i>30-40 minutes!</i> There is very little prep involved and a simple list of ingredients needed. Slightly firm on the outside and amazingly soft on the inside, and depending on how you like them you can bake the nicest corner pieces with an extra minute or two in the oven! I am allergic to nuts, every single one of all kinds so it is up to you whether you'd like to add them to your recipe or not! :)</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cocoa powder (put more if you want just not too much!)</li>
        <li>2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup melted unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>nuts are optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 F or 175 C and oil up a baking pan</li>
        <li>Combine all ingredients (except nuts if you are including them) until you have formed a nice batter. Then spread the batter onto your baking pan, and sprinkle nuts on top if you would like.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20-30 minutes, test readiness with the <a href="https://bakinghow.com/if-brownies-are-done/#:~:text=To%20see%20if%20your%20chewy,165%20and%20210%C2%B0F.">toothpick test</a>. Then you may let them cool on a wire rack before cutting and enjoying!</li>
    </ol>
