    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chocolate chip cookies, what a classic. These are very easy to make and this is my go to recipe to make whenever I'm craving a quick snack. These can be made in under <strong>20 minutes</strong>, <i>including</i> the prep and the bake time. They only require 4 ingredients, and there's no need for a mixer! I thought about making some while writing this guide, the taste is amazing, the texture is perfect, and the speed at which you can make these at is the cherry on top!</p>
