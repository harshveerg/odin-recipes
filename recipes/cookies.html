    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chocolate chip cookies, what a classic. These are very easy to make and this is my go to recipe to make whenever I'm craving a quick snack. These can be made in under <strong>45 minutes</strong>, <i>including</i> the prep time, bake time, and cooling. They only require a few ingredients. I thought about making some while writing this guide! The taste is <i>amazing</i>, the texture is <i>perfect and fluffy</i>, and the speed at which you can make these at is the cherry on top!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Chocolate chips (as desired, but don't put too many!)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F or 190 degrees C. Place parchment paper on two baking sheets and set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine dry ingredients (not the sugars) in a large mixing bowl. Whisk the flour, baking soda, and salt to ensure even mixture.</li>
        <li>Combine wet ingredients (and sugars). Use a mixer on medium-high speed to beat the butter and sugars together in a separate bowl. Mix until light and fluffy. Add eggs one by one, beating the mixture before adding in the second egg. Lastly, add the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients to the mixing bowl, and use the mixer at a reduced speed to combine them.</li>
        <li>Once a dough has been made, add the chocolate chips to the bowl and use a utensil to hand stir</li>
        <li>Scoop out 12 evenly sized, heaping spoons of dough onto each lined baking sheet, roll each scoop into a ball. Evenly space your cookies and bake! If there's any left over dough, bake it at the end after your baking sheets have cooled down from the first batch of cookies.</li>
        <li>After 6-8 minutes, rotate your baking sheets to ensure even heat distribution all cookies for optimal consistency. Bake until golden brown, usually 12-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let your cookies cool down on the baking sheet for a couple minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to completely cool down. Once cool, you can enjoy your cookies right away or store them in an air-tight container for up to a week. </li>
    </ol>
