    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chocolate chip cookies, what a classic. These are very easy to make and this is my go to recipe to make whenever I'm craving a quick snack. These can be made in under <strong>45 minutes</strong>, <i>including</i> the prep time, bake time, and cooling. They only require a few ingredients. I thought about making some while writing this guide! The taste is <i>amazing</i>, the texture is <i>perfect and fluffy</i>, and the speed at which you can make these at is the cherry on top!</p>
