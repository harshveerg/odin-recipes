    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chocolate chip muffins, another <strong><i>classic</i></strong> baked good. Very easy to make with only 10 minutes of prep time and 20 minutes bake time required. These are a classic morning go-to snack for me, especially when I need something quick and delicious. I bake a bunch on a Sunday morning, and store them in the fridge for the week. When I want one in the mornings I just heat it up for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate chips a bit and I'm <i>golden</i>! Super <i>quick and easy</i> to make and enjoy on the go!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
        <li>2/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
        <li>2/3 vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup chocolate chips <i>(put as many as you like, but not too many!</i></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425F or 220C, and line muffin tray and place to the side while the oven is preheating</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine all of your dry ingredients. All dry ingredients apart from the brown sugar.</li>
        <li>In a medium mixing bowl, combine your wet ingredients and your brown sugar. After they are thoroughly mixed, combine your wet ingredients with your dry ingredients in the large bowl. Continue mixing until flour is no longer visible and the mixture appears as a batter
        <li>Fold in <i>most</i>, not all, of your chocolate chips until evenly dispersed in the batter. The remaining chips will be added on top of your batter after it has been poured on to the muffin tray.</li>
        <li>Pour mixture evenly into the muffin liners on the muffin tray. Fill each cup 3 quarters of the way to the top and then top with remaining chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Place tray into the oven, reduce your heat to 350F or 175C and bake for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, use a toothpick to test the centre of a muffin to see if it is done. The toothpick should ideally be semi clean with a little bit of crumbs on it.</li>
        <li>Let cool in the tray for 10 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack. If any batter remains, repeat this process.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><em>Enjoy!</em></h2>
